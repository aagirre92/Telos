# TELOS

## DOCUMENT PURPOSE

This document captures the TELOS method of articulating a person's personal context so that they, and AI, can better understand them and help them improve. Pay attention to the items and the concepts here, and especially on how they work together.

The conceptual path is Problems -> Mission -> (Narratives) -> Goals -> Challenges -> Strategies â€”> Projects -> Journal. This means that any project you're doing can be mapped all the way back up to the problem(s) you're trying to solve. This gives you transparency and explainability in everything you're doing so you don't end up busy for days/months/years without being able to remember why you're doing what you're doing.

Other sections that aren't those core sections are additional context to support them.

## HISTORY

- I grew up in Eibar (Basque Country)
- I went to Aldatze (Santa MarÃ­a de la Providencia) high school. Not my favourite place because all my friends were on distinct schools but it is what it is
- Collegue was a great experience, I learnt that meaningful achievements need suffering and hard work

## PROBLEMS

- P1: Not enough people understand how to build secure open-source software

## MISSION

- M1: Create and promote a standard for building secure open-source software

## NARRATIVES

- N1: I think open-sources software is the future, and it's currently extremely insecure, so I'm building a standard and platform for people to create secure versions of whatever they build
- N2: I am the author of a platform that helps people create secure software.
 
## GOALS

- G1: Power Snatch 80kg
- G2: Be assertive with work/life balance
- G3: Take care of myself and the people I love, making it priority nÂº1

## CHALLENGES

- C1: I tend to repress emotions like anxiety, anger and fear, which causes me back pain. I should just stop and ask myself how I feel (and be more open with it)
- C2: I can't multitask. If I am deeply working into something, meetings fuck me up so bad


## THINGS I'VE BEEN WRONG ABOUT

- All people are good by nature, honest and pragmatic
- You are not a special snowflake (*You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake. You are the same decaying organic matter as everything else*)
